## Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction Project

### Project Description
This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can predict the risk of CKD based on patient data.

### Project Steps
1. **Data Preparation**: Loading, cleaning, and preparing the data for modeling.
2. **Data Analysis**: Initial analysis to understand patterns and trends in the data.
3. **Model Building**: Using various machine learning models to predict CKD, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
4. **Population Clustering**: Applying K-Means clustering to create a subgroup within the population for further analysis.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (Area Under the Curve), and using undersampling to balance the target variable.
6. **Model Explanation**: Using LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to provide clear and understandable explanations for the model's decisions.

### Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- XGBoost
- LIME

### Results
The best-performing model was selected based on the mentioned metrics and adapted for practical use as a tool for predicting CKD risk.

### Conclusions
The project demonstrates that machine learning techniques can be effectively used to accurately predict the risk of Chronic Kidney Disease, aiding in preventive medicine and early treatment.
